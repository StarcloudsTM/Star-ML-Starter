## Overview
Describe the goal of your project, the problem it solves, and any relevant context. Explain the type of model used and the key technologies involved.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Link to dataset or description of source]
- **Description**: Briefly explain the dataset, including features, target variable, and size.
- **Preprocessing**: Summarize data cleaning, normalization, or feature engineering steps.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

# Create virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'env\\Scripts\\activate'

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Provide instructions to run the project:
```bash
# Example of running model
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
```
Explain different command-line options or configuration files.

## Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Describe the algorithm or architecture (e.g., Linear Regression, CNN, RNN, etc.)
- **Hyperparameters**: List key hyperparameters used.
- **Training**: Summarize the training process, including train/test split and cross-validation.

## Results
